CS61 x86-64 Assembly Cheat Sheat

A. Registers
A1. There are a total of 16 general purpose (GP) registers.
A2. There are <HOWMANY> GP registers with symbolic names.
A3. They are: <LIST ALL THE NAMED REGISTERS>
A4. There are <HOWMANY> GP registers with number names.
A5. They are: <DESCRIBE/LIST ALL THE NUMBERED REGISTERS>
A6. rip is: <DESCRIBE IT>
A7. rsp is: <DESCRIBE IT>
A8. rbp is: <DESCRIBE IT>

B. Parameter passing
B1. The first argument to a function is passed in register rdi.
B2. The second argument to a function is passed in register rsi.
B3. The third argument to a function is passed in register rdx.
B4. The fourth argument to a function is passed in register rcx.
B5. The fifth argument to a function is passed in register r8.
B6. The sixth argument to a function is passed in register r9.
B7. The seventh argument to a function is passed as memory on the stack.

C. Addressing modes
C1. $N (for N a number) means:
C2. The expression %REG (for REG a register) means:
C3. (%REG) means:
C4. (%REG, %REG) means:
C5. (%REG, %REG, N) for N=1, 2, 4 or 8 means:
C6. N(<MODE>) for addressing mode C3, C4, or C5 means:
C7. lea<TYPE> (for TYPE one of b,w,l,q) means:

D. x86 flags
For each of the following flags, write down what it means for the flag
to be set:
D1. SF
D2. CF
D3. ZF
D4. OF

E. Instructions whose only purpose is to set flag values:
Explain how each instruction sets the flag registers.
E1. cmp operand1, operand2
E2. test operand1, operand2

F. Jump Instructions
For each jump instruction below, write the expression describing when
the jump will be taken. You will undoubtedly find it useful to
describe this both in terms of which flags you must check but also,
assuming that the previous operation were a cmp or test instruction,
what relationship the operands of the previous instruction have, e.g.,
op1 > op2, or op1 != 0, or whatever applies.
